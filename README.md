- [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/Sea_Level_Predictor) 
  
  Analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880, using the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050. 

- [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/demographic_data_analyzer) 

  Analyze demographic data using Pandas from a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

- [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/mean_var_std) 

  Creating a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix. 

- [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/medical_data_visualizer) 

  Visualizing and making calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.  

- [Calculations](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/my_demo_proj2) 
 
  Aplikacje (pl).

- [Program do analizy danych (Pl)](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/python_streamlit_demo) 

  Program do analizy danych (pl).  Web application using the library Streamlit.


- [Page View Time Series Visualize](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/time_series_visualizer) 

  Visualizing time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots, using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the   number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.  

- [SQLite](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/SQLite) 

  SQLite examples.

- [Budget App](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/Budget_App) 

  Complete the Category class in budget.py. It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment.

- [Polygon Area Calculator](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/Polygon_Area_Calculator) 

  In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

- [Arithmetic Formatter](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/arithmetic_arranger) 

  Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.
  
- [Probability Calculator](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/ProbabilityCalculator) 

  For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

- [Time Calculator](https://github.com/MarynaSnl/my_demo_proj/tree/main/time_calculator) 

  Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:
    a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
    a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
    (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
